### LTI 시스템이 중요한 역할을 하는 이유
---
1. Many physical processes posses Linearity and Time Invariance properties thus can be modeled as LTI systems
2. LTI systems can be analyzed in considerable detail, providing both insight into their properties and a set of powerful tools that form the core of signal and system analysis.

### 그럼 어떻게 혀?
---
1. Represent the input to an LTI system in terms of a linear combination of a set of basic signals
2. Use superposition to compute the output of the system in terms of its responses to these basic signals

- Unit impulse → very general signals can be represented  as linear combinations of delayed impulses.
- superposition + time invariance → characterization of any LTI systems in terms of its response to a unit impulse with convolution sum(integral).
